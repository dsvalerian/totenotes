# ToteNotes Frontend

## Style Guide

### Folder Structure
Mostly based on [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md).

Top-level `app`, `features`, and `shared` folders. Split features by folder in top-level `features`. 
Within top-level `shared` and specific feature folders, have `components`, `types`, `api`, `utils`, etc folders.

### File and Folder Names
Use `kebab-case`.

### Component and Type Names
Use `PascalCase`.
